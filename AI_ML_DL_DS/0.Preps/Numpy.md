# What is Numpy?

To go in deeper besides calling it a powerful library, Numpy is short for Numerical Python and is the heart of the ecosystem of many data science tools. It is a c-extension library which makes it a prime tool for array computing. This package can create, find the min and max, sum the entire array, and manipulate large datasets effortlessly. This is partly due to Numpy’s fixed-type arrays.

A normal Python list has the ability to have many different types within its structure, such as integers, string, float, ect and this causes more information about the list to be stored within the computer. `On the other hand, Numpy arrays are only able to contain one type` which allows the computer to only point to one information storage instead of in python’s list to a list of memory locations then taking extra time to retrieve the information.
