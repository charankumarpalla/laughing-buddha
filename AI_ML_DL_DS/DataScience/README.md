# 🏗️ DataScience .....IN PROGRESS 🚧

> Why is an apple, an apple and not a monkey? Because your brain (**intelligence**) process the information (**data**) correctly that is gathered by your eyes (**sensor**) by continuously learning and reasoning those things (**science?**). Humans have been doing this since forever... For us this is trivial. However, human brain has certain cognitive limitations in terms of information fetching and `processing, memory, recognition, prediction` and so on....so powerful computers can help. With the improvements and advancements in technology, hardware and computing resources, we can now gather ample data from almost everything for e.g. your smart phone leaves traces of your movements and locations, your online search behaviour is stored, how you use television can be captured, how you purchase stuff at a superstore is recorded, even how you walk in the city is monitored by CCTV and so on. Our data is being captured everywhere and all the time without us noticing it. Does this data worth anything or to anyone? Yes, it does! Ask advertisers, who want to provide dedicated ads to maximize their business, ask people who want applications for health and fitness, e.g. health tracker, fall detector etc, .

> - What we just saw above is the 'data' side of the things. Now Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and allied fields help in providing systematic and scientific methods to provide useful insights, predictions, recognitions and analytical solutions from this gigantic data. Hence you can combine two ideas together and say '**data science**' is indeed important.

DataScience is a vast combination of data tasks which may include any one particular area or all of the below areas

# Introduction

## What is Data Science ?

Being said and heard more about of Data Science there's been more confusion or no particular definition as one concludes one set of operations as Data Scientist job in converse with other defining it differently.

on reason for such confusions

</p>

Collect -> Store -> Process/Analyse -> Describe -> Model

with the segregation of tasks involved in data science, Now let's define Data Science as "the science of C`ollecting.Storing,Processing,Describing and Modelling Data`"

### Collecting

So what is involved in Collecting data and this is again depends on

- Depends on the environment

  - > Data is plenty availability

    He/she is working in `like Data rich org`
    Eg : `Amazon` where data is Structured data stored in Structred Data(RDBMS) or UnStructured Data(Json) with little Db Quesries he can collect his data

  - > Data Already exist but need on within org

    Data Scientist working for a Polictical Party to analyse how Govt policies are working

    Eg: Here as compared to above example of Amazon ,we dont have a set of consolidated data , but data is available in unsorted mode either in Social Media or on policy feedback form with little/no access to data. So DS has to write crawlers to read these data across domains.

  - an `NGO where we need to go out and fetch data`

- Question that Data Scientist going to Answer
- What kind of problem we are interested in
