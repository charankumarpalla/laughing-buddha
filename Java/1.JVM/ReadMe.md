1.	We write the Java source code in Simple.Java file using an editor or IDE (integrated development environment) e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea.
2.	Program has to be compiled into bytecode. Java compiler (javac) compiles the sourcecode to Simple.class file.
3.	This class file can be executed in any platform/OS by JVM (Java virtual machine).
4.	JVM translates bytecode into native machine code which machines can execute.

# **JVM** = Class loader system + runtime data area + Execution Engine.


Every developer who uses Java knows that Java bytecode runs in a JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The most important element of the JRE is Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which analyzes and executes Java byte code. Java developers do not need to know how JVM works. So many great applications and libraries have already been developed without developers understanding JVM deeply. However, if you understand JVM, you will understand Java more, and will be able to solve the problems which seem to be so simple but unsolvable.

The JRE is composed of the Java API and the JVM. The role of the JVM is to read the Java application through the Class Loader and execute it along with the __[Java API](#javaApi)__.

> Java application programming interface (API) is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK). It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with their methods, fields, and constructors. These prewritten classes provide a tremendous amount of functionality to a programmer.



A virtual machine (VM) is a software implementation of a machine (i.e. a computer) that executes programs like a physical machine. Originally, Java was designed to run based on a virtual machine separated from a physical machine for implementing WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere), although this goal has been mostly forgotten. Therefore, the JVM runs on all kinds of hardware to execute the Java Bytecode without changing the Java execution code.

***The features of JVM are as follows:***
* **Stack-based virtual machine**: The most popular computer architectures such as Intel x86 Architecture and ARM Architecture run based on a register. However, JVM runs based on a stack.
* **Symbolic reference:** All types (class and interface) except for primitive data types are referred to through symbolic reference, instead of through explicit memory address-based reference. 
* **Garbage collection:** A class instance is explicitly created by the user code and automatically destroyed by garbage collection.
* **Guarantees platform independence by clearly defining the primitive data type:** A traditional language such as C/C++ has different int type size according to the platform. The JVM clearly defines the primitive data type to maintain its compatibility and guarantee platform independence.
* **Network byte order:** The Java class file uses the network byte order. To maintain platform independence between the little endian used by Intel x86 Architecture and the big endian used by the RISC Series Architecture, a fixed byte order must be kept. Therefore, JVM uses the network byte order, which is used for network transfer. The network byte order is the big endian.

Sun Microsystems developed Java. However, **any vendor can develop and provide a JVM by following the Java Virtual Machine Specification**. For this reason, there are various JVMs, including _Oracle Hotspot JVM and IBM JVM_. The Dalvik VM in Google's Android operating system is a kind of JVM, though it does not follow the Java Virtual Machine Specification. Unlike Java VMs, which are stack machines, the Dalvik VM is a register-based architecture. Java bytecode is also converted into an register-based instruction set used by the Dalvik VM.


The architecture of the JVM enables detailed control over the actions that a Java application performs. **It runs in a sandbox environment and ensures** that the application does not have access to the local file system, processes, and networking without proper permission. In case of remote execution, code should be signed with a certificate.


## Architecture
The JVM specification defines the subsystems and their external behavior. _The JVM has the following major subsystems_:

- **Class Loader** -  Responsible for reading Java source code and loading classes into the data areas.
- **Execution Engine** - Responsible for executing instructions from the data areas.
- **Memory Model** - The Java memory model is built on the concept of automatic memory management. 

The data areas occupy memory that is allocated by the JVM from the underlying OS

<br>

### Class Loader
The JVM uses different class loaders organized into the following hierarchy:

- **The bootstrap class loader** is the parent for other class loaders. It loads the core Java libraries and is the only one written in native code.
- **The extension class loader** is a child of the bootstrap class loader. It loads the extension libraries.
- **The system class loader** is a child of the extension class loader. It loads the application class files that are found in the classpath.
- **A user-defined class loader** is a child of the system class loader or another user-defined class loader.



> When a class loader receives a request to load a class, it checks the cache to see if the class has already been loaded, then delegates the request to the parent. If the parent fails to load the class, then the child attempts to load the class itself. A child class loader can check the cache of the parent class loader, but the parent cannot see classes loaded by the child. The design is such because a child class loader should not be allowed to load classes that are already loaded by its parent.



### Execution Engine

The execution engine executes commands from the bytecode loaded into the data areas one by one. To make the bytecode commands readable to the machine, the execution engine uses two methods.

- **Interpretation:**  The execution engine changes each command to machine language as it is encountered.
- **Just-in-time (JIT) compilation:** If a method is used frequently, the execution engine compiles it to native code and stores it in the cache. After that, all commands associated with this method are executed directly without interpretation.

<br>

### Memory Model


The Java memory model is built on the concept of automatic memory management. When an object is no longer referenced by an application, a garbage collector discards it and this frees up memory. This is different from many other programming languages, where you have to manually unload the object from memory.

The JVM allocates memory from the underlying OS and separates it into the following areas.

- **Heap Space :** This is a shared memory area used to hold the objects that a garbage collector scans.
- **Method Area:** This area was previously known as the permanent generation where loaded classes were stored. It has recently been removed from the JVM, and classes are now loaded as metadata to native memory of the underlying OS.
- **Native Area:** This area holds references and variables of primitive types.


Breaking the heap up into generations ensures efficient memory management because the garbage collector does not need to scan the whole heap. Most objects live for a very short time, and those that survive longer will likely not need to be discarded at all until the application terminates.

When a Java application creates an object, it is stored in the eden pool of the heap. Once it is full, a minor garbage collection is triggered at the eden pool. First, the garbage collector marks dead objects (those that are not referenced by the application any more) and increments the age of live objects (the age is represented by the number of garbage collections that the object has survived). Then the garbage collector discards dead objects and moves live objects to the survivor pool, leaving the eden pool clear.

When a surviving object reaches a certain age, it is moved to the old generation of the heap: the tenured pool. Eventually, the tenured pool fills up and a major garbage collection is triggered to clean it up.

When a garbage collection is performed, all application threads are stopped, causing a pause. Minor garbage collections are frequent, but are optimized to quickly remove dead objects, which are the major part of the young generation. Major garbage collections are much slower because they involve mostly live objects. There are different kinds of garbage collectors, some may be faster in certain situations when performing a major garbage collection.

The heap size is dynamic. Memory is allocated to the heap only if it is required. When the heap fills up, the JVM reallocates more memory, until the maximum is reached. Memory reallocation also causes the application to stop briefly.



#### Performance Optimization


The performance of the JVM depends on how well it is configured to match the functionality of the application. Although memory is automatically managed using garbage collection and memory reallocation processes, you have control over their frequency. In general, the more memory you have available for your application, the less memory management processes are required, which pause your application.

If garbage collections are occurring more frequently than you would want, you can start the JVM with more maximum heap size. The longer it takes for a generation of the heap to fill up, the fewer garbage collections occur. To configure the maximum heap size, use the -Xmx option when you start the JVM. By default, the maximum heap size is set to either 1/4th of the physical memory available to the OS, or to 1 GB (whichever is the smallest).

If the problem is with memory reallocation, you can set the initial heap size to be the same as the maximum. This means that the JVM will never need to allocate more memory to the heap. However, you will also lose the adaptive memory optimization gained from dynamic heap sizing. The heap will be of fixed size from the moment you start your application. To configure the initial heap size, use the -Xms option when you start the JVM. By default, the initial heap size is set to either 1/64th of the physical memory available to the OS, or to some reasonable minimum that is different for different platforms (whichever is the largest).

If you know which garbage collections (minor or major) are causing performance degradation, you can set the ratio between the young and old generations without changing the overall heap size. For applications that create a lot of short-lived objects, increase the size of the young generation (this will leave less memory for the old generation). For applications that operate with a lot of longer surviving objects, increase the size of the old generation (by setting less memory for the young generation). The following ways can be used to control the sizes of the young and old generations.


- Specify the ratio between the young and old generation using the -XX:NewRatio option when you start the JVM. For example, to make the old generation five times larger than the young generation, specify -XX:NewRatio=5. By default, the ratio is set to 2 (the old generation occupies â…” of the heap, and the young generation occupies â…“).
- Specify the initial and maximum size of the young generation using the -Xmn option when you start the JVM. The old generation size will be set to whatever memory remains on the heap.
- Specify the initial and maximum size of the young generation separately, using the -XX:NewSize and -XX:MaxNewSize options when you start the JVM. The old generation size will be set to whatever memory remains on the heap.


Most applications (especially servers) require concurrent execution, handling a number of tasks. Some of these tasks are more important at a given moment, while others are background tasks that can be executed whenever the CPU is not busy doing anything else. Tasks are executed in different threads. For example, a server may have a low-priority thread that calculates statistics based on some data and starts a higher-priority thread to handle incoming data, and another higher-priority thread to serve a request for some of the data that was calculated. There can be many sources of data, and many clients requesting data from the server. Each request will briefly stop the execution of the background calculation thread to serve the request. So you have to monitor the number of threads that are running and make sure there is enough CPU time for the thread that is making the necessary calculations.

Each thread has a stack that holds the method calls, return addresses, and so on. Some memory is allocated for the stack, and if there are too many threads, this can lead to an OutOfMemory error. Even if you have enough heap memory allocated for objects, your application may be unable to start a new thread. In this case, consider limiting the maximum size of the stack in threads. To configure the thread stack size, use the -Xss option when you start the JVM. By default, the thread stack size is set to 320 KB or 1024 KB, depending on the platform.


#### Performance Monitoring

Whether you are developing or running a Java application, it is important to monitor the performance of the JVM. Configuring the JVM is not a one-time affair, especially if you are dealing with a server running on Java. You have to constantly check the allocation and usage of both heap and non-heap memory, the number of threads that the application creates, and the number of classes that are loaded into memory. These are the core parameters.

Using the Anturis Console, you can set up monitoring of the JVM for any hardware component (such as a computer running a Tomcat web server) in your infrastructure by adding the JVM monitor to the component.

_The JVM monitor can measure the following metrics._

- **Total memory usage (MB)** is the amount of memory that the JVM uses. This metric can affect overall performance of the underlying OS if the JVM consumes all available memory.
- **Heap memory usage (MB)** is the amount of memory that the JVM allocates for objects used by the running Java application. Unused objects are regularly removed from the heap by the garbage collector. If this metric grows, it can indicate that your application is not removing references for unused objects, or that you need to configure the garbage collector properly.
- **Non-Heap memory usage (MB)** is the amount of memory allocated for the method area and the code cache. The method area is used to store references to loaded classes. If these references are not removed properly, the permanent generation pool can increase every time the application is redeployed, leading to a non-heap memory leak. It can also indicate a thread-creation leak.
- **Total pool memory usage (MB)** is all the memory used by the various memory pools allocated by the JVM (that is, the total memory without the code cache area). This can give you an idea of how much memory your application consumes without the JVM overhead.
- **Threads** (threads) is the number of active threads in the JVM. For example, each request to a Tomcat server is processed in a separate thread, so this metric can give you an idea of the number of requests that are currently being served, and whether it affects the background tasks that are running in threads set to a lower priority.
- **Classes (classes)** is the number of loaded classes. If your application dynamically creates a lot of classes, this can be a source of a severe memory leak.

`JVM turns into an occurrence of JRE at runtime of a Java program. It is generally known as a runtime interpreter. JVM â€” to a great extent â€” helps in the deliberation of internal execution from the software engineers who make utilization of libraries for their projects from JDK.`

# **JRE** = JVM + libraries to run Java application.


> In simple words JRE = JVM + rt.jar
   where rt.jar contains lang, util, awt, swing, math etc. libraries or compiled .class files used to run our program.
   
>JRE is the box and JVM is the content of the box.

A software program needs to execute, and to do that it needs an environment to run in. The runtime environment loads class files and ensures there is access to memory and other system resources to run them. In the past, most software used the operating system (OS) as its runtime environment. The program ran inside whatever computer it was on, but relied on operating system settings for resource access. Resources in this case would be things like memory and program files and dependencies. The Java Runtime Environment changed all that, at least for Java programs.




**What Does the JRE Comprise Of?**
JRE comprises the accompanying segments.

- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, including Java HotSpot Client and Server Virtual Machines.
- Deployment Techniques â€“ It includes arrangement, Java Web Start, and Java Plug-in.
- UI toolkits â€“ User Interface including Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing, Java 2D, Accessibility, Image I/O, Print Service, Sound, intuitive (DnD), and information techniques.
- Integration libraries â€“ It includes Interface Definition Language (IDL), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Remote Method Invocation over Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (RMI-IIOP) ), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), and scripting.
- Other base libraries, including worldwide help, input/yield (I/O), expansion instrument, Beans, Java Management Extensions (JMX), Java Native Interface (JNI), Math, Networking, Override Mechanism, Security, Serialization, and Java for XML Processing (XML JAXP).
- Lang and util base libraries â€“ It includes lang and util, administration, forming, zip, instrument, reflection, Collections, Concurrency Utilities, Java Archive (JAR), Logging, Preferences API, Ref Objects, and Regular Expressions.

# **JDK** = JRE + Development/debugging tools

- It is a bundle of software that you can use to develop Java based applications.
- Java Development Kit is needed for developing java applications.provides tools for 
    -  develop
    -  compile
    -  debug
    -  run a program
- The JDK needs more Disk space as it contains the JRE along with various development tools.


The JDK is the Java Development Kit, the full-featured SDK for Java. It has everything the JRE has, **but also** the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). It is **capable of creating and compiling programs**.

Usually, if you only care about running Java programs on computer you will only install the JRE. It's all you need. On the other hand, if you are planning to do some Java programming, you need to install the JDK instead.

Sometimes, even if you are not planning to do any Java development on a computer, you still need the JDK installed. For example, if you are deploying a web application with JSP, you are technically just running Java programs inside the application server. Why would you need the JDK then? Because the application server will convert JSP into Java servlets and needs to use the JDK to compile the servlets.

# TakeAways :

#### Compilation at JDK Level
First, the source â€˜.javaâ€™ file is passed through the compiler, which then encodes the source code into a machine independent encoding, known as Bytecode. The content of each class contained in the source file is stored in a separate â€˜.classâ€™ file. While converting the source code into the bytecode, the compiler follows the following steps:

- Parse: Reads a set of *.java source files and maps the resulting token sequence into AST (_**Abstract Syntax Tree**_)-Nodes.
- 	Enter: Enters symbols for the definitions into the symbol table.
-	Process annotations: If Requested, processes annotations found in the specifed compilation units.
-	Attribute: Attributes the Syntax trees. This step includes name resolution, type checking and constant folding.
-	Flow: Performs dataflow analysis on the trees from the previous step. This includes checks for assignments and reachability.
-	Desugar: Rewrites the AST and translates away some syntactic sugar.
-	Generate: Generates â€˜.Classâ€™ files.



> How can we verify that the JVM successfully executes the class file verification process? How can we verify that various JVMs from various JVM vendors satisfy the JVM specifications? For verification, Oracle provides a test tool, TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit).

#### JVM VS Hotspot
The definition of what exactly is a Java Virtual Machine is stated in the Java Virtual Machine Specification

The JVM is by definition a virtual machine, i. e. a software machine that simulates what a real machine does. Like a real machine, it has an instruction set, a virtual computer architecture and an execution model. It is capable of running code written with this virtual instruction set, pretty much like a real machine can run machine code.

HotSpot is an  **implementation of the JVM concept**. It was originally developed by Sun and now it is owned by Oracle. There are other implementations of the JVM specification, like JRockit, IBM J9, among many others.
