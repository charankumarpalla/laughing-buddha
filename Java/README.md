At the heart of Java technology lies the Java Virtual Machine--the abstract computer on which all Java programs run. Although the name ``"Java"`` is generally used to refer to the Java programming language,
there is more to Java than the language. **`The Java Virtual Machine, Java API, and Java class file work together with the Java language to make the Java phenomenon possible.`**


Here we show how the Java Virtual Machine fits into the big picture, show how the virtual machine relates to the other components of Javaís architecture: the class file, API, and language. They describe the motivation behind--and the implications of--the overall design of Java technology.


This chapter gives an introduction to Java as a technology. It gives an overview of Javaís architecture, discusses why Java is important, and looks at Javaís pros and cons.
