# Introduction

A collection, as name implies, is **` group of objects`**. 

**`Java Collections framework consist of the interfaces and classes `** which helps in working with different types of collections such as `lists, sets, maps, stacks and queues etc`.

These ready-to-use collection classes solve lots of very common problems where we need to deal with group of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous objects. The common operations in involve `add, remove, update, sort, search and more complex algorithms`. These collection classes provide very transparent support for all such operations using **`Collections APIs`**.

# Java Collections Hierarchy

The Collections framework is better understood with the help of core interfaces. The collections classes implement these interfaces and provide concrete functionalities.
