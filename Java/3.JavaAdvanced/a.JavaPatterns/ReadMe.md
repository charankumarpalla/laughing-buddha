**Design Patterns** are very popular among software developers. A design pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.

##  Java Design Patterns
Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:

-   Design Patterns are already defined and provides industry standard approach to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many java design patterns that we can use in our java based projects.
-   Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
-   Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new members of team understand it easily.

Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories – `creational, structural, and behavioral` design patterns. This post serves as an index for all the java design patterns articles I have written so far.

##  Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate a object in the best possible way for specific situations.

### Singleton Pattern
Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java virtual machine. It seems to be a very simple design pattern but when it comes to implementation, it comes with a lot of implementation concerns. The implementation of the Singleton pattern has always been a controversial topic among developers - [here](../a.JavaPatterns/GangOfFour_Patterns/1a.SingletonPattern.md)
