# MultiThreading

Writing correct programs is hard; writing correct concurrent programs is harder.
There are simply more things that can go wrong in a concurrent program than
in a sequential one. So, why do we bother with concurrency? Threads are an
inescapable feature of the Java language, and they can simplify the development
of complex systems by turning complicated asynchronous code into simpler
straight-line code. In addition, threads are the easiest way to tap the computing
power of multiprocessor systems. And, as processor counts increase, exploiting
concurrency effectively will only become more important.
