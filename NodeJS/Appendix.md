# IIFA -> Immediatly Invoked Function Expression

You can execute a function immediately after you define it. Simply wrap the function in parentheses () and invoke it,


```

(function foo(){
    console.log("Hello");
})();

```

The reason for having an immediately executing function is to create a new variable scope. An if, else, or while does not create a new variable scope in JavaScript

```
var foo = 123;
if (true) {
    var foo = 456;
}
console.log(foo); // 456;
```

The only recommended way of creating a new variable scope in JavaScript is using a function. So, in order to create a new variable scope, we can use an immediately executing function,

```
var foo = 123;
if (true) {
    (function () { // create a new scope
        var foo = 456;
    })();
}
console.log(foo); // 123;
```

# Anonymous Function

A function without a name is called an anonymous function. In JavaScript, you can assign a function to a variable. If you are going to use a function as a variable, you donâ€™t need to name the function.

```
var foo1 = function namedFunction() { // no use of name, just wasted characters
    console.log('foo1');
}
foo1(); // foo1

var foo2 = function () {              // no function name given i.e. anonymous function
    console.log('foo2');
}
foo2(); // foo2
```


A programming language is said to have `first-class functions` if a function can be treated the same way as any other variable in the language. **JavaScript has first-class functions**.


In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be:

- stored in a variable, object, or array
- passed as an argument to a function
- returned from a function


# Higher-Order Functions

Since JavaScript allows us to assign functions to variables, we can pass functions to other functions. `Functions that take functions as arguments are called higher-order functions`. A very common example of a higher-order function is setTimeout.

```
setTimeout(function () {
    console.log('2000 milliseconds have passed since this demo started');
}, 2000);
```

If you run this application in Node.js, you will see the console.log message after two seconds and then the application will exit. Note that we provided an anonymous function as the first argument to setTimeout. ***This makes setTimeout a higher-order function***.

It is worth mentioning that there is nothing stopping us from creating a function and passing that in.

```
function foo() {
    console.log('2000 milliseconds have passed since this demo started');
}
setTimeout(foo, 2000);
```



# Promises
*The best Resource*: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-promises/

```
let completed = true;

let learnJS = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (completed) {
            resolve("I have completed learning JS.");
        } else {
            reject("I haven't completed learning JS yet.");
        }
    }, 3 * 1000);
});
```
