# All About Flutter Introduction

Flutter is Google's portable UI framework for building modern, native, and reactive applications for iOS and Android.
Google is also working on Flutter desktop embedding and Flutter for the Web (Hummingbird) and embedded devices (Raspberry Pi, home, automotive, and more). Flutter is an open‐source project hosted on GitHub with contributions from Google and the community. Flutter uses Dart, a modern object‐oriented language that compiles to native ARM code and production‐ready JavaScript code.

The Flutter UI is implemented by using widgets from a modern reactive framework. Flutter uses its own rendering engine to draw widgets.

# Types of Widget

We can split the Flutter widget into two categories:

- Visible (Output and Input)
- Invisible (Layout and Control)
